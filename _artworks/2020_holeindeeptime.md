With the help of massive Explosives, rock has been excavated in industrial scale, leaving an opening into a lost world. A section into earth history. A window into ‘deep time’, long before the evolution of higher life forms on earth: the layers of rock are billions of years old, risen from the depth of the earth mantle.

After the abandonment of the quarry, it has been recolonised. The open cliffs and inaccessibility to humans attract falcon, bats, and the rare eagle owl. Plants arrive from close by and from far across the world and reclaim the ground, compete for it, and establish a new kind of equilibrium. A novel ecosystem emerges.

The Anthropocene is the era of human-nature. It requires a new rooting of our concepts. We expose ourselves to the ‚Hole in deep time‘.
A dialogue that brings forth patterns and recordings, reports, discussions, interpretations, declarations of love, syntheses. In these stories, the hole in deep time – as a human-nonhuman-collective – becomes self-aware.
