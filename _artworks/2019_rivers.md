In the morning, we had a guided tour at the visitor center of Naturschutzgebiet KÃ¼hkopf, a protected area of an old river arm of the Rhine. The river has been straightened and deepend for ship transport beginning in the 19th century.

The story of the straightened riverbed is what inspired 'Rivers', which I was filming at the beach of the river in the afternoon.
