Our paper on spatially heterogeneous pressure and catastrophic shifts has been [reviewed by Donald DeAngelis and Simeon Yurek for F1000 Prime](http://f1000.com/prime/726120793). Unlike [our article](http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12080-015-0289-1.pdf), the review is behind a paywall, but maybe your university has a subscription.
