The Ecological Trait-data Standard has been released as v0.9 on [GFBio Terminology Service](https://terminologies.gfbio.org/terminology/?ontology=ETS) with stable URIs and [full documentation](https://terminologies.gfbio.org/terms/ets/pages/). Contributions and discussion on proposed terms is highly appreciated and coordinated via [Github Issues](https://github.com/EcologicalTraitData/ETS/issues).
