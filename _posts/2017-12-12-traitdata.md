A long overdue update: I've been working on a project facilitating traitdata harmonization. This includes a [standard vocabulary for trait datasets](https://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/ETS/), as well as an [R package 'traitdataform'](https://ecologicaltraitdata.github.io/traitdataform/) that moulds data of heterogeneous formats into a harmonized form, making merging of distributed trait data easy.
