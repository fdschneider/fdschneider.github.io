I'm really happy that I can participate again in an art project this year. The [Global Nomadic Art Project Germany](https://2019.gnap.info/en/) currently takes place in Darmstadt with the title 'Nature Art Fieldworks', with more than 20 artists from all over the world. They visit 14 places in Darmstadt and the surroundings to have a dialogue with nature. I was invited to join as a 'science expert' and as an artist.
