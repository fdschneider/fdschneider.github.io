After a successful pre-print last year and quite some discussion and networking, our paper introducing the ETS is now accepted for publication in [Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.13288). It facilitates the standardisation of trait-data for publication and re-use in data analysis.
