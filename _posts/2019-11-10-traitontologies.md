Two weeks ago, I was presenting the Ecological Trait-data Standard Vocabulary (ETS) at the Biodiversity Next conference in Leiden, Netherlands. The Ecological Trait-data Standard Vocabulary (ETS) and the scope of the Open Traits Network (OTN) plans to develop ontologies for trait data fit in nicely. I [summarized my thoughts in a blogpost](blog/2019/traitontologies/).  
All of these ideas should be taken as suggestions. The sole purpose of this draft is to provide a first  vision  and spark a discussion for the OTN strategy towards trait ontologies.
